                    The visibility of the system status for both the webpage and the servers for star citizen are present on the website, however they are not visible on the landing page. To view the status of the website and the game servers, you are required to go to a different sub-page which will show a generic status indicator. This system is better than nothing as it allows for users to find the system status, but it can be difficult to find. Additionally, the server status messages are very generic, and do not do a good job relaying accurate statuses, in real time. The game has been in a state of “degraded performance” for around a month.

                <p class="list-body">
                    The website does a good job relaying information regarding purchases to a user in a similar fashion to how information would be relayed to a perspective homeowner. When purchasing a ship, you have a large amount of information that is visible about its statistics and what can be changed. In addition, you can often see images of different location in and around the ship. This is like a listing for a house where you could see how many bedrooms and bathrooms there are and find out how much the previous owner payed in taxes, and potentially utilities.

                <p class="list-body">
                    The user control and freedom for the website is not very good, with exception of the return to home option by clicking on the RSI logo in the corner. The website is extremely clunky to maneuver through, with many option requiring 4+ clicks, going through multiple menus, to get to the desired page. On top of this, with out setting bookmarks, the website has no ways of allowing users to speed up interaction. Even the status page for the website and game servers is difficult to find, as it is not located on the home page.

                <p class="list-body">
                    The website is good for many of the normal interactions a user might have with it and can be consistent in many areas. However, in some places, especially dropdown menus, it suffers in the consistency and standards area, largely due to some interactions being controlled by clicking, and some interactions being hover and open a sub-menu. When interacting with most previews for informational or content pages, it is done by your standard interaction click, and this works well. Where the issues begin, is when some items can be both clicked and hovered over. This happens with some menus. When clicked on you are routed to one place, and when hovered over, a sub menu is displayed allowing for other interaction.

                </p>
                <p class="list-body">
                    The website has little to no error prevention in most areas. The lack of error prevention is not surprising as most websites struggle with how to prevent users from making errors when navigating to the wrong page or other similar mistakes. However, when trying to make a purchase the website does have a generic system to prevent the user from putting in incorrect payment information, and it also has a system to remind a user that they are not logged in if they are looking at making a purchase. This system is effective and does help to prevent the user from potential mistakes.

                </p>
                <p class="list-body">
                    The website as stated before can be complex, and unforgiving. This leads to many instances where the user needs to recall what a box/selection takes them to, or if a menu is accessed by clicking on it, or by hovering over it. Additionally, there are no on-screen indicators to allow the user to rapidly determine the function of each item. Only by trial and error, and recollection, are users able to navigate faster. One solution to solve this problem would have been to use a symbol or indicator to identify what type of selection the user was hovering over or clicking on. This is shown by the two images below, where in the same bar, different selections have different interaction properties.

                </p>
                <p class="list-body">
                    The flexibility and efficiency of use of this website is average. For many interactions there is no way of speeding them up. If you are going to a specific page, and are only using tools provided by the website, there will be only one path to get there. The redeeming factor of the website is the large number of links to recent content on their home page. This allows users to potentially go to information about recent events, and updates faster than navigating there through their forms, but it also adds a large amount of clutter to the home page.

                </p>
                <p class="list-body">
                    The website is aesthetically a fantastic looking website, and it matches the futuristic theme that is being developed for the games it supports. However, the website is extremely cluttered, and many pieces of irrelevant information are shown on most pages. Although there are no direct advertisements, there are many links that will take you to pages on new vehicles that are being released, from which you could click on another link and go to a store front. In addition, random statistics can be found all over the homepage, leading to a feeling of randomness.

                <p class="list-body">
                    The ability to recover from errors is poor, the website basically states that there was an error and redirects the user back to the homepage. The only other state at which it is slightly different than this is when a user is not logged into their account, and they go to purchase something, the system will generally tell them that they are not logged in.

                <p class="list-body">
                    a.	There is little to no help or documentation for both the webpage and the game it supports. Recently, the developers requested people to make guides on how to start, so that they would not have to work on a tutorial or update existing ones. As previously mentioned, there is some documentation for the game, however, most of the existing information is old, and may not be applicable. This is due in part to a user interface overhaul happened in the last year, and the fact that the game is still in alpha. On top of the previously mentioned issues, the documentation is stuck behind 4+ menus.
